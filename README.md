# Belly Button Biodiversity
### Plotly | JavaScript | HTML | D3.js


In this project, I have created an interactive dashboard using Plotly to help participants, from a biodiversity research group, and researchers access and explore the information collected from the study. The research was conducted by Improbable Beef, a company who manufactures synthetic beef.

When users select an ID number, they can observe the top ten bacterial species found in participants' belly buttons. Each volunteer's information is displayed as follows:

1. A bar graph and gauge chart.
The bar graph displays the top ten bacterial cultures found and the gauge chart displays the frequency each participant washes his/her belly button per week.

2. A bubble chart showing the bacterial cultures per sample.

When a sampple is selected from the dropdown menu, the interactive charts update showing the information of the participant selected.
